## Description

This is a simple webpage, using similar CSS styling options used in my first demo, that will present a few multiple choice options for the user to answer and then submit. Once submitted, the answers will be stored and reposted on the website, as well as that data will be run through a loop to determine an answer that is also displayed on the site.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

Using your Github account, go to your Gitbash terminal and use the: $git clone https://github.com/JuanHasZem/second_demo  command to download a copy of the files used for this project. Then open the file labeled index.html to open the website and test the page out.

Currently impossible to get all possible outcomes, this is by design for this project but would be a serious design flaw if this were a real project.
